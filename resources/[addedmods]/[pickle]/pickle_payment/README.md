## What is this?
   
<p>This is a multi-framework payment system.</p>

<p>It's a great fit for any type of roleplaying server, whether it's Serious RP or not.</p>

With this resource, you will be able to do the following:

- Add Registers.
- Charge Customers via Cash / Card automatically.
- Itemize your charges with individual names and prices.
- Restrict Registers to multiple jobs.
- Payout to either businesses or the cashier themselves.

## Supported Frameworks

- ESX 1.1+ & Legacy
- QBCore
- Standalone (Code your own bridge)

## What do I need?

Use a supported framework or make it work with yours via the bridge folder.

<a href='https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/'>Ox Lib</a> (Required).

## Licensing

<p>Do not at any point redistribute this without my permission and credit.</p>
<p>I've already had to issue reports on people selling my Television Script (which is free).</p>
<p>That is not fair to anyone, especially to the people who get scammed out of their money.</p>
<p>So please, respect the rules and have fun!</p>
