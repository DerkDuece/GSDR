# acidtrip_rework
Rework of the original acid trip script https://forum.cfx.re/t/release-acid-trip/

# Why a rework?
As mentioned by original author of the resource, script uses Drawbox native to make all shapes which are significantly penalizing to the performance while the script is actively working. It also uses Youtube iFrame API to play the audio from the video which is also significant reason of performance loss so I decided to tweak the resource a little bit to optimize the performance according to my needs.
While script is a little resource intensive when actively drawing shapes,  it has no effect on performance when being idle which is a big upside when compared to other resource.

# Installation and usage
